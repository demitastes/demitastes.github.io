I started reviewing whiskey in 2020 by seeking out the kinds of things my friends might want to try, and quickly moved to seeking the unique and interesting. These days I focus most of my energy on American Single Malt Whiskey, including creating the subreddit [/r/AmericanSMW][r-asmw]. I enjoy Single Malts from around the world, as well as a little of everything else, including Bourbon, Brandy, Rum, and Mezcal. I’ve been using usernames starting with “Demi” since forever, so when I noticed my habit of pouring what seemed to be the smallest drams around the web, and the obvious pun with the small espresso cup called a _demitasse_, I decided that the name “DemiTastes” only made sense.

I'm currently importing my archive of 100+ spirits reviews and counting to
[MaltRunners.com](https://maltrunners.com), a collaborative review blog from some of the best enthusiast spirits reviewers out there.
We already have 1000+ reviews published on this site and between us we have 7000+ reviews in our archives.

Check back here to also find links to articles, videos, and podcast audio featuring interviews, industry topics,
and anything else that comes up along the way to writing and publishing the book on American Single Malt Whiskey.

I hope to turn this domain into my own personal blog and review archive. Check back soon for that!
